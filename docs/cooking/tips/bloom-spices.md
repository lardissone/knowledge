# Bloom your spices

> A smart way to use up the dry spices in your cabinet is to embrace the beauty of the hot oil sizzle. Also known as “blooming” your spices, this technique is fast and easy but offers huge returns. In a small skillet or saucepan, cover whole seeds—such as fennel, mustard, cumin, or coriander—in just enough extra-virgin olive oil (or other vegetable oil) to coat, then heat over medium-low until the oil is sizzling and the seeds start to darken and/or pop. That’s all it takes to extract and deepen the aromatic flavors in the spices while simultaneously seasoning the oil itself. (Finer, more delicate spices that could burn should be added at the very end, including crushed red pepper flakes or pre-ground spices.) The spice oil, now loaded with texture and infused with the essence of the seeds, can be used in lots of different ways. For this recipe, it becomes a quick marinade for squeaky halloumi cheese, but you could just as easily spoon it over roasted vegetables or onto a creamy pureed soup. To make a robust vinaigrette, season with salt and pepper and whisk in fresh lemon juice or any vinegar that you like (start with 2 parts oil to 1 part acidic component, then adjust as needed). Stir it into Greek yogurt or labne and serve that dip with crudités, or pair it with grilled meats as a cooling side dish. With this trick at your disposal, you never need to wonder what to do with a jar of spices again.
