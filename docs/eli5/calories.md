# Consumed calories vs burnt calories

> 2000 calories is your body doing all the "keeping you alive" and it never stops and this is over 24 hours.
>
> 100 calories is you making the body work really fast but over a short period... 10 minutes say. If you keep that effort up for 24 hours, you'd be using err... 14,000 calories or so.
>
> The difference you're missing is the time frame.
